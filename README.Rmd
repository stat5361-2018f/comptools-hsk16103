# Explaination of Building Process
- Follow the instruction at <https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/get-started.html> 
- Actually, although we can fix most error by downloading the packages from Tools in RStudio, there were some problems during building this process.

## Problem 1
devtool <- CRAN does not support this package, so we have to install it directly from 'github' using `'devtool::install_github()'`.

## Problem 2
the latest version of Rtools <- In my case, I installed the latest version of Rtools 3.5.1 for building process

## Problem 3
system.time(mclapply(1:10, pause(0.25), mc.cores = cores)) is not support by Windows. I followed the recommendation of one of the students. I did first set up a local cluster and then use `parLapply(): \indexc{mclapply()} \indexc{parLapply()}`
